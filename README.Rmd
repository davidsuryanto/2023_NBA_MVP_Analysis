## Project Goal: Predict The 2023 NBA MVP

## Dataset:

Please see <https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html> for info on variables

## Sample Tables:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/top5mvp.R')
knitr::kable(recentmvp, caption = "Table 1: Recent NBA MVPs")
knitr::kable(lowpoints, caption = "Table 2: MVPs with Lowest PPG")
```

### **Table 1: MVP Winners (1982-2022)**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/Creating MVP Model.R')
knitr::kable(mvps)
```

### **Table 2: MVPs Win/Loss Percentage**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/Creating MVP Model.R')
knitr::kable(mvp_win_loss, caption = "Note: Only 11 out of the 41 (26.8%) MVP winners from 1982-2022 have win/loss percentage below 70% and only 3 of them are below 60%.")
award_share_wlp
```

### **Graph: Correlation Between MVP Share and PER rating**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/Creating MVP Model.R')
award_share_per
```

Note: MVPs average PER rating = 28.3 and Non-MVPs average PER rating = 12.7. This proves how crucial it is for NBA players to have a high PER rating in order to be considered in the MVP race.

### **Graph:** Correlation Between MVP Share and Win Share

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/Creating MVP Model.R')
award_share_ws
```

Note: MVPs average win share = 16.02 and Non-MVPs average win share = 2.62. This proves how crucial it is for NBA players to have a high win share % in order to be considered in the MVP race.

### **Graph: Correlation Between MVP Share and True Shooting %**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/Creating MVP Model.R')
award_share_ts
```

Note: MVPs average true shooting(%) = 59.3% and Non-MVPs average true shooting(%) = 51.3%. This proves how crucial it is for NBA players to have a high true shooting % in order to be considered in the MVP race.
