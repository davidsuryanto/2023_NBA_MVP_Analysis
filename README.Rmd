## Project Goal: Predict The 2023 NBA MVP

## Dataset:

Please see <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robertsunderhaft/nba-player-season-statistics-with-mvp-win-share> for the data set on NBA players (1982-2022) and information on variables

### **Table 1: MVP Winners (1982-2022)**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/MVP_Correlation.R')
knitr::kable(mvps)
```

### **Table 2: MVPs Win/Loss Percentage**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/MVP_Correlation.R')
knitr::kable(mvp_win_loss, caption = "Note: Only 11 out of the 41 (26.8%) MVP winners from 1982-2022 have win/loss percentage below 70% and only 3 of them are below 60%.")
award_share_wlp
```

### **Graph: Correlation Between MVP Share and PER rating**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/MVP_Correlation.R')
award_share_per
```

Note: MVPs average PER rating = 28.3 and Non-MVPs average PER rating = 12.7. This proves how crucial it is for NBA players to have a high PER rating in order to be considered in the MVP race.

### **Graph:** Correlation Between MVP Share and Win Share

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/MVP_Correlation.R')
award_share_ws
```

Note: MVPs average win share = 16.02 and Non-MVPs average win share = 2.62. This proves how crucial it is for NBA players to have a high win share % in order to be considered in the MVP race.

### **Graph: Correlation Between MVP Share and True Shooting %**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/MVP_Correlation.R')
award_share_ts
```

Note: MVPs average true shooting(%) = 59.3% and Non-MVPs average true shooting(%) = 51.3%. This proves how crucial it is for NBA players to have a high true shooting % in order to be considered in the MVP race.

# **Decision Tree Model**

> formula \<- award_share \~ mp_per_g + g + pts_per_g + trb_per_g + ast_per_g + stl_per_g + blk_per_g + fg_pct + win_loss_pct + per + ows + dws + ws_per_48 + obpm + dbpm + ts_pct
>
> tree_model \<- rpart(formula, data = train_data)

```{r echo=FALSE}
source('R/MVP_Model.R')
rpart.plot(tree_model)
```

### **Testing the Decision Tree Model for the Highest Predicted MVP Award Share and Actual MVP Winners for each year**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/MVP_Model.R')
knitr::kable(tree_top_predicted_winners)
```

Note: Only 28 out of the 41 **(68%)** predicted results match the actual winners

### **Top 5 Predicted 2023 MVP Candidates (Decision Tree)**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/MVP_Model.R')
knitr::kable(top_10_tree_pred)
```

Predicted Winner: Nikola Jokic

# **Linear Regression Model**

> lm_model \<- lm(award_share \~ mp_per_g + pts_per_g + trb_per_g + ast_per_g + stl_per_g + blk_per_g + ws + ws_per_48 + win_loss_pct + per + ts_pct, data = train_data)

```{r echo=FALSE}
source('R/MVP_Model.R')
summary(lm_model)
```

### **Testing the Model for the Highest Predicted MVP Award Share and Actual MVP Winners for each year**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/MVP_Model.R')
knitr::kable(top_predicted_winners)
```

Note: Only 23 out of the 41 **(56%)** predicted results match the actual winners

### **Top 5 Predicted 2023 MVP Candidates (Linear Regression)**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source('R/MVP_Model.R')
knitr::kable(top_10_lm_pred)
```

Predicted Winner: Nikola Jokic
